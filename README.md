Yet another simple UI for youtube-dl, specialised in multi-chapter videos.

This is a **personal** project, and I'm only making the code public because someone might find it useful.

I'm creating this project so that I can download multi-chapter music compilations from Youtube effortessly and mostly automatically, in such a way that each song goes in its own mp3 file and I can easily add to my winamp playlists. Yeah, as sad or as funny as it sounds. This means:

- The features are designed to be useful to me, in particular to a niche use case.
- It's very lacking in features compared to the full youtube-dl. This is expected. Youtube-dl is a far more complex project than this.
- This is intended to be a one week (or less) project, and therefore I'm not going to bother with even unit tests.
- There is a chance that someone might find this useful, but lacking some feature. I encourage you to fork the code and add whatever you like, but I'm not likely to accept pull requests (I'm likely to not even notice that they exist).

This project is based on [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). These pieces of software are not included in this repository. I'm also, additionally, planning to use it along with the [Open With](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-with/) Firefox extension, so that I can easily invoke it on any youtube video I happen to be watching; but having this extension is not strictly needed to run this software, whereas youtube-dl and ffmpeg are mandatory.

Yes, the title is a very stupid bilingual joke. I'm sorry.
